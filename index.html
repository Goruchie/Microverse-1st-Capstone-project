        full of wonders in the heart of Budapest, Hungary. It lies close to the city centre, giving festival goers the chance to explore Budapest anytime during their stay.

          <p class="text-green-light-6">
            The first Sziget Festival was organized back in 1993 as a small gathering and has since evolved into one of Europe’s largest music festivals. 
            Each year we strive to bring Szitizens some of the biggest names out there, and host over 1,000 shows across 60 stages, for 6 days straight.

          </h3>
          <p class="text-green-light-6">
            There are over 100 nationalities represented at Sziget, with people coming from as far away as Brazil or New Zealand. 
            This peaceful gathering of different cultures for the common cause of music, celebration and entertainment is what the Island of Freedom is all about.

            Art and Inspiration
          </h3>
          <p class="text-green-light-6">
            While music is an important part of Sziget, art is also a core element. There are multiple venues including a circus, theater, museum quarter and much more. Artists and performers come 
            from all over the world to display their talents. There are also opportunities for Szitizens and artists to work together in order to create memorable and meaningful artwork.

            Roads give you chances to seek and explore. Want an adventure? Just open your door. Award-winning author Pat Zietlow Miller's lilting rhymes celebrate the possibilities that 
            lie beyond the next bend in the road--the same road that will always lead you home again. Look back at Sziget 2019, where these words were brought to life on the Island of Freedom!

            Our cause: SUPERAR
          </h3>
          <p class="text-green-light-6">
            Sziget partnered with Superar this year, to support the program’s initiative on spreading music to children coming from underprivileged backgrounds. 
            Music is a powerful tool that can help children improve their focus, motivation, creativity and confidence, while allowing them to overcome socio-economic boundaries. 
            Every reusable cup dropped off at a collection point at Sziget, went towards supporting the Superar program.
